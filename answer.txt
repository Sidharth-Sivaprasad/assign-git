What does fast-forward in Git mean?
In fast-forward we merge or rebase against a branch that is ahead or has a newer version than the one we have checked-out.
Here we change the pointer of one branch to match the one that had a later commit. It may be one commit or more.

Why should you have different branches?
A branch creates a different isolated development line from the main stable branch. It lets members of a development team work individually and work on different features. This lets them work in isolation and then merge to the main branch when needed. It promotes parallel development. 

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
It is possible to have unlimited Git repositories for a project. But 1 git repository is usually enough for a project, by default its origin when you clone a repository.
